The idea of {cloze paragraph style} is to be able to recognise any paragraphs that contain {cloze deletions}.

The script should ignore paragraphs that have math formatting like $\frac{3}{4}$ but no actual cloze deletions.

With {2:CurlyCloze} enabled, you can also use the {c1|easier cloze formatting},
but of course {{c3::Anki}}'s formatting is always an option.
